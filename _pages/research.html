        <img src="/assets/img/aed-by-cnn/fcn_model.jpg">
        <p>In this topic, we try to discover not only <strong>the sound events happened in an audio clip</strong> (clip-level information) but also <strong>the temporal positions of the detected sounds</strong> (frame-level information). Since creating frame-level annotated data can be extremely time-consuming, we proposed a model based on <strong>convolutional neural networks</strong> that relies on <strong>data with only clip-level labels (weakly supervised data) for training</strong>.</p>
